Used underscore.js - third party library

Pushing phase II as a separate branch called "phase2". 
Currently deleted my last phase since it was pushed as a rails app (which I had done in order to deploy on heroku) and I currently didn't have the time to push the current phase having had that on the master. I will find a way to push phase 1 back asap.
